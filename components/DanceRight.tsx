            Bharatanatyam is one of the oldest classical dance forms in India,
            rooted in Tamil Nadu. It combines intricate footwork, expressive
            hand gestures (mudras), and dramatic facial expressions to convey
            stories, often of Hindu deities. Traditionally performed in temples,
            it now flourishes on global stages, blending spirituality, artistry,
            and storytelling with rhythm and grace.
